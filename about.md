I am Rohith Mukku, a software engineer at Samsung R&D Institute Delhi. I graduated from the department of Computer Science & Engineering at IIT Kanpur in 2018. I work on
Tizen kernel and Visual Display applications. I am a huge fan of football and I never miss any matches of my favourite club (Chelsea). Analyzing statistics fascinate me 
and writing scripts for these tasks is a lot of fun.

Broadly, my interests lie in:

* Emulators, OS level concepts
* AI algorithms
* Reinforcement Learning and AGI
