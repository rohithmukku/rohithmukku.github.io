I am Rohith Mukku, a Masters student at New York University. Currently, I am a part of [CILVR](https://cilvr.cs.nyu.edu/) lab at NYU under the supervision of Prof. [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/). Prior to this, I worked as a software engineer at Samsung R&D Institute Delhi and my work was primarily on Tizen kernel and Visual Display applications. I graduated from the department of Computer Science & Engineering at IIT Kanpur in 2018. I am a huge fan of football and I never miss any matches of my favourite club (Chelsea). Analyzing statistics fascinate me and writing scripts for these tasks is a lot of fun. Recently, I started developing interest in Deep Learning (thanks to the [NYU DL](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/) course) and I'm trying to explore the recent research trends and their applications in general.

Broadly, my interests lie in:

- Emulators, OS level concepts
- Deep Learning
- Reinforcement Learning and AGI
- Natural Language Processing
